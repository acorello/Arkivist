// TODO: book to some Notion DB

/*
right hand: map Notion API, practice interfacing with an HTTP
API in Go, understand better how Notion works so that I can
find more ways to leverage it and perhaps come up with a
commercial integration.

left hand: upload all my books to my Books database on Notion
so that I can consult their table-of-contents, importa pages,
and use notion as an hyperbook (highlights, paraphrasing,
	summary, comments, â€¦?)
